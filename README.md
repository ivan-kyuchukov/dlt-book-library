# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test

npx hardhat deploy-testnets --network goerli --private-key {{YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY}}
npx hardhat verify-contract --network goerli --contract-address {{CONTRACT_ADDRESS_RETURNED_FROM_DEPLOY}}
```
